-- 0041_expense_cost_management_fix.sql
-- Resume/fix for 0040_expense_cost_management.sql after a live migration
-- attempt failed partway through.
--
-- ROOT CAUSE: 0040's `create or replace function public.get_load_profitability`
-- inserted a new `pending_direct_cost` column into the MIDDLE of the
-- function's existing RETURNS TABLE column list (between other_direct_cost
-- and total_direct_cost, which were adjacent in 0038). Postgres rejects
-- that as an incompatible return-type change ("cannot change return type
-- of existing function") -- CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION can only be used
-- when the output column list is unchanged; a DROP FUNCTION is required
-- first. This exact rule was already learned earlier this session (0036,
-- the carrier-settlements CASCADE fix) but was not re-applied when this
-- specific function was rewritten -- confirmed live: the enums, expenses
-- table columns, triggers, and the expense summary/direct-cost RPC
-- functions from 0040 all committed successfully (the SQL editor runs each
-- statement up to an explicit `commit;` as a real checkpoint), but
-- execution stopped at the failing CREATE OR REPLACE, so
-- get_load_profitability was left on its old (0038) shape and the
-- expense-documents storage bucket/policies after it never ran either.
--
-- 0040 itself has been corrected in place (drop function added before the
-- recreate) so a FRESH database applying 0001-0040 in order won't hit
-- this. This file exists to bring an ALREADY-PARTIALLY-MIGRATED database
-- (yours) the rest of the way, without re-running anything that already
-- succeeded and would now fail with "already exists" (as you saw when
-- retrying the whole 0040 script from the top). Do NOT re-run
-- RUN_THIS_FOR_EXPENSE_COST_MANAGEMENT.sql on this database -- run ONLY
-- this file.
